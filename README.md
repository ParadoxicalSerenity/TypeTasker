## Why another Task Runner?

I started working on TypeTasker simply because I simply don't like any other existing options that I've come across for one reason or another.

## Is the API stable?

Not really, I'm still in the early stages of figuring out how I want this to work long term so anything before version 1.0.0 is expected to have breaking changes almost every release.
